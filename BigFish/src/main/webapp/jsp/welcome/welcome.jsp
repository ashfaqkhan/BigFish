                <p>Change Management helps organizations understand and work to minimize risks of changes to the IT environment. 
				  It is essentially a process for managing the people-side of change. 
				 BigFish helps implement your Change Management process by providing on-demand capabilities for creating, assessing, approving and 
				 implementing changes to your environment. </p>
				 
				<p>Within the platform, changes are handled using the task record system. Each change is generated through a variety of means as a 
				task record, populated with the pertinent information in individual fields. These tasks can be assigned to appropriate change management
				team members, who will deal with the task as appropriate. Once the change has been properly implemented, it is closed.</p>

				<p>
				A new change record can be generated in a number of ways: <br>
					An IT team member (role: itil) can generate a change by hand through Change > Create New or clicking New from the change record list.<br> 
					An IT team member (role: itil) can request a change through the Service Catalog. <br>
					A change can be requested from an incident. <br>
					A change can be requested from a problem. <br>
					If a user attempts to create a generic task, the task interceptor will first ask them to specify what sort of task they would like to create. In this way, tasks are always assigned a handling process. <br>
					If an appropriate inbound email action is configured, it can be generated from an email. <br>
